here at fitst I made a mistake by putting origin into shm_test, but in fact it should be git_test.

so when git push it cannnot find the repo.

use    git remote -v   to detect this error

then   git remote rm origin  to remove the mistaken origin

then   git remote add origin git@github.com:songhuiming/git_test.git   to create remote origin again

then   at last we can push into origin repo
