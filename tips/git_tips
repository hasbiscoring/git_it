***  Q1:  remove file accidentally added to the repository

	filename.orig was accidentally added to repo, so how to delete them?

	method 1: Please don't use this recipe if your situation is not the one described in the question. This recipe is for fixing a bad merge, and replaying your good commits onto a fixed merge.

Although filter-branch will do what you want, it is quite a complex command and I would probably choose to do this with git rebase. It's probably a personal preference. filter-branch can do it in a single, slightly more complex command, whereas the rebase solution is performing the equivalent logical operations one step at a time.

Try the following recipe:

####################################################################################
# create and check out a temporary branch at the location of the bad merge
git checkout -b tmpfix <sha1-of-merge>

# remove the incorrectly added file
git rm somefile.orig

# commit the amended merge
git commit --amend

# go back to the master branch
git checkout master

# replant the master branch onto the corrected merge
git rebase tmpfix

# delete the temporary branch
git branch -d tmpfix
####################################################################################

	method 2: If you haven't committed anything since, just git rm the file and git commit --amend.

If you have, git filter-branch --index-filter 'git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch filename.orig' merge-point..HEAD will go through each change from merge-point to HEAD, delete filename.orig and rewrite the change. Using --ignore-unmatch means the command won't fail if for some reason filename.orig is missing from a change. That's the recommended way from the Examples section in the git-filter-branch man page.
