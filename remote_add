So far everything you've done has been in your local repository, meaning you still haven't done anything on GitHub yet. To connect your local repository to your GitHub account, you will need to set a remote for your repo and push your commits to it:

git remote add origin git@github.com:username/Hello-World.git# Creates a remote named "origin" pointing at your GitHub repo
git push origin master# Sends your commits in the "master" branch to GitHub

Now if you look at your repository on GitHub, you will see your README has been added to it.
