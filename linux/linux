###  linux: how Shell locates the file  ###
to run the scr in your own dir, like /home/hsong/first.scr, need to run it at /home/hsong/   like /bin/sh /home/hsong/first.scr
to overcome this inputing path, you need to create your own bin like:
$cd                     (go to the home dir)
$mkdir bin              (create bin dir, install your own shell script so that script can be run as independent program)
$cp first ~/bin         (copy your script first to the bin dir)
$first                  (run it)



###  vi: how to search in vi with case insensitive  ###
in vi, run this   :set ignorecase(or :set ic)  , that's it
turn it on so no need to bother typing the :set each time, using  echo set ignorecase >>.exrc in your home directory, the .exrc is read each time when you start vi.
More .exrc is a startup file (or configuration) file for the vi editor 



###  vi: search and replace
The :substitute command searches for a text pattern, and replaces it with a text string. There are many options, but these are what you probably want:

:s/foo/bar/g
Find each occurrence of 'foo' (in the current line only), and replace it with 'bar'.

:%s/foo/bar/g
Find each occurrence of 'foo' (in all lines), and replace it with 'bar'.

:%s/foo/bar/gc
Change each 'foo' to 'bar', but ask for confirmation first.

:%s/\<foo\>/bar/gc
Change only whole words exactly matching 'foo' to 'bar'; ask for confirmation.

:%s/foo/bar/gci
Change each 'foo' (case insensitive) to 'bar'; ask for confirmation.
This may be wanted after using :set noignorecase to make searches case sensitive (the default).

:%s/foo/bar/gcI
Change each 'foo' (case sensitive) to 'bar'; ask for confirmation.
This may be wanted after using :set ignorecase to make searches case insensitive.

The g flag means global ÎíÎñ each occurrence in the line is changed, rather than just the first. This tip assumes the default setting for the 'gdefault' and 'edcompatible' option (off), which requires that the g flag be included in%s///g to perform a global substitute. Using :set gdefault creates confusion because then %s/// is global, whereas %s///g is not (that is, g reverses its meaning).
If you use the c flag, you need to confirm for each match what to do. Vim will output something like:replace with foobar (y/n/a/q/l/^E/^Y)? (where foobar is the replacement part of the :s/.../.../command. You can type y which means to substitute this match, n to skip this match, a to substitute this and all remaining matches ("all" remaining matches), q to quit the command, l to substitute this match and quit (think of "last"), ^E to scroll the screen up by holding the Ctrl key and pressing E and ^Y to scroll the screen down by holding the Ctrl key and pressing Y. However, the last two choices are only available, if your Vim is a normal, big or huge built or the insert_expand feature was enabled at compile time (look for +insert_expand in the output of:version).
