     1: online in the repo and click Admin, then just change the name and click Rename.
     2: local change the repo dir name to the same as online name, and then git remote rm origin to remove the origin link. Then git remote add git@github.com:ur_username/ur_new_repo.git


2: let's talk something about git merge
     1: create a new branch git_merge
     2: create a file vi git_merge
     3: git add git_merge
     4: git commit -m "test git merge"
     5: merge with master ----->
        5.1 git checkout master
        5.2 git merge git_merge
     6: git commit master


3: undoing things 
     1: change your last commit    git commit --amend
     2: if you want to unstage a file(this file is not committed), then you use   git reset HEAD fine_name
     3: unmodify a modified file, change it back to last modified status     git checkout -- filename


4: git reflog : Know where you want to reset, rather than using HEAD~ HEAD^ HEAD^^ and so on
     1: using git reflog to find the original HEAD you want to go to ( referenced as HEAD@{0} )
     2: git reset --hard HEAD@{n}
     This is very helpful for you to go whereever you want to go
