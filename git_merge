1: create a new branch git_merge
2: create a file   vi git_merge
3: git add git_merge
4: git commit -m "test git merge"
5: merge with master  -----> 
   5.1  git checkout master
   5.2  git merge git_merge
6: git commit master


sometimes maybe it's necessary to avoid others push to the master. users can only push to the branch. then the owner merge them to the master

is this logic right?
